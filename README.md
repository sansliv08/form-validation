# Form Validation
This project allows to validate:
- no field remains empty
- minimum length of username and password
- password validation with [RegExr](https://regexr.com/3bfsi)
- correct email and website format 
- password and confirm password match

If the form is validated, an object is created with the data entered, which can be viewed on the console.
